# Step 1: Introduction to Java and Development Environment

In this step, you will set up your development environment and ensure that Java is correctly installed.

## What is Java?

Java is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its portability, reliability, and extensive libraries. It is a great starting point for anyone new to programming.

## Verify Your Environment

1. Open the terminal in the provided environment.
2. Run the following command to check if Java is installed:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```{{exec}}

   *Click the command above to execute it.*

3. You should see output similar to this:

   ```
   java version "17.x.x"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.x.x)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.x.x, mixed mode)
   ```

4. If Java is not installed or the version is incorrect, it will be installed automatically during this tutorial.

## Next Step

Once Java is confirmed to be installed, proceed to Step 2 to write your first Java program.
